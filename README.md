# PlantSensee

PlantSense is a user-friendly, web-based solution designed to help farmers identify and manage plant diseases without the need for expensive technology such as drones, thermal sensors, or specialized hardware. Farmers can simply upload an image of their plant, and our platform—powered by YOLOv11—will quickly analyze the photo, providing detailed insights on any detected diseases.
